        <h1>"God must have loved the common man, that he created so many of them" – Abraham Lincoln</h1>
        <p>On Planet Earth, from a statistical point of view, every living creature since the dawn of history was born with a different gene composition, differentiating him from any other living creature in the world. This fact is extremely important, and upon its derivatives, we must ask the following questions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What exactly differentiates one living creature from a second living creature?</li>
            <li>Can two living creatures be 99.9% similar genetically and personality-wise?</li>
            <li>Why do we feel so unique, as we all probably felt throughout our lives?</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Who are the very, very, very few people that history remembers as "Uncommon People"? Regarding their work, contributions, and mark.</li>
            <li>If we can come to a consensus on the latter, then who are the remaining "Common People"?</li>
            <li>What does it mean to be "Common" and what does it mean to be "Uncommon"?</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Let's find out!</b></p>
        <p>Below is Time Magazine's ranking of the 100 most influential figures in history:</p>
        <img src="../Images/test who's biggest.jpg" alt="Ranking Chart" class="image">
        <p>With no effort at all, you'll be able to distinguish uncommon people from the ranking above. Right? We all studied one of these uncommon people, or at the very least, know one of them by name. And yet, do you know who their rivals were? Who was their spouse? Their sons, daughters, and parents? Who were their role models and mentors? Hard, isn't it? It's striking to calculate that even if there are one thousand uncommon people living today on Planet Earth out of the 8.2 billion people who live today, they represent 0.0000122%. Take another look over Time Magazine's ranking, please. Let's say we will come to a consensus over one thousand people now that can fit the degree, magnitude, and scale of impact, similar to the people in the ranking (at least in the Western Hemisphere). Out of the 117 billion people who lived throughout history, these one thousand, the most uncommon people in history represent only 0.000000855% of the human population.</p>
        <p>"View From The Top" is a fifty-year-long program that runs at Stanford University, where MBA students interview world-class business leaders. From Bill Gates to Jeff Bezos and Oprah Winfrey. These interviews bring the guest speaker into the light beyond his or her public image and offer the student the opportunity to engage in effective leadership, decision-making, and personal values. Furthermore, View From The Top hosts a private, off-the-record lunch with the guest speaker for fifteen selected students. What we like to call: "Golden Opportunities" that one cannot find anywhere else in the world. When I finished my military service and returned from a two-month "into the wild" hitchhiking trip in Alaska, alone and without any SIM or SOS phone, including a few days in Hawaii to change temperature, I felt I was the stupidest guy on earth. I knew nothing except surviving in nature. And in that, I was relatively mediocre, I felt. Well, Alaska's wilderness isn't an easy environment. Luckily after a month, my life changed forever: I was accepted to "Colliers International" to be an asset manager. It was a job where you had to have a degree, although I didn't have one and had zero experience in life at the age of twenty-one, due to my military service. I felt so stupid and lagging behind that I had to re-architect my brain. I woke up at 06:24 A.M. to read, and after work, I was watching interviews with the greatest leading figures. To me, since our brain cannot process all of the amount of information we hear and see in a day, and cannot filter and store exactly the knowledge that we'd like to store in our memory, the only way to get extremely better in no time is to learn from the best. We'll dive into Meccas and Environments in later posts. From an interview to an interview, thanks to the YouTube algorithm, I encountered View From The Top. I watched every single episode out there, and last year I co-founded the program at my university: Reichman University (formerly IDC) in cooperation with Prof. Niron Hashai, Dean of Arison School of Business, and under the guidance of Liz Walker, head of the program at Stanford University. On every event, we impact between two hundred fifty to five hundred students.</p>
        <p>In April 2010, the prominent guest speaker at Stanford was Ted Turner. During his life, Ted founded CNN, donated a billion dollars to the United Nations Foundation, and even chaired the organization. In addition, Ted was a philanthropist and worked on environmental and sustainable initiatives. Ted was a father of five and a three-time divorcee. During the interview, Ted highlighted the two primary contributors to global warming in his perspective:</p>
        <p>The sharp rise in the human population: a more than threefold increase during his lifetime.</p>
        <p>The significant growth in life expectancy. The chart below illustrates these changes, showcasing the exponential rise in world population from 2.24 billion in 1938 to nearly 7 billion by 2010 (the year the interview was conducted), alongside the increase in global life expectancy from 64 years to 79 years over the same period.</p>
        <img src="../Images/Ted Turner Graphs.jpg" alt="Ted Turner Graph" class="image">
        <p>In his own idiosyncratic manner, Ted, half-joking and half-serious, approached and asked the audience: "Do you know what would happen if nine billion elephants lived on Planet Earth?" With no further ado, Ted answered his own question: "We'll all be elephant dung"! When I listened to Ted, I was very serious and eager to learn every insight he had to share. Yet, I couldn't stop myself from rolling with laughter! I wrote down another great quote he said: <b>"Don't spend your time with dumb people, only with smart ones."</b> Gosh, he was right.</p>
        <p><b>Let's ask ourselves completely seriously:</b> If nine billion elephants were living today on Planet Earth, what the !@ck were they actually doing here? Pause for a second: what do you think?</p>
        <p>I kept thinking about this question for a few days, and I don't know why, so don't judge me, please. The more I thought about it, the more I took it seriously. To me, and I'm not a zoologist, they would mainly sleep, mate, and pave routes in the savannas and jungles to find the most abundant water and food sources. Elephants tend to live in herds, and in most elephant herds, there are a lot of elephants who follow the very few herd leaders. In nature, the herd leader tends to be the strongest, the biggest, who can protect the herd against upcoming dangers, who can lead safely in extreme life-or-death moments, who can pioneer new food and water sources, who can ensure the survival of future generations. On paper at least, the herd leader is born with a superior physical gene combination, leaving aside for a moment whether he or she (mainly he) will be fed correctly and won't die before maturity. Therefore, it is no wonder that females prefer to mate only with the herd leader. What Charles Darwin referred to as sexual selection<sup>1</sup>. The females do so to bequeath their offspring better genes, rather if they would mate with random males out of love and rapport<sup>2</sup>. Luckily, humans mate and build relationships differently, and we don't care solely for these physical components. Human leaders as well bear different traits besides physical superiority. We're now moving away from elephants and focusing on humans, as you can see. Since the dawn of history, humans have been accustomed and adapted to live in tribes and small communities that gradually evolved into larger social organizational forms. Yet unlike in nature, the lives of humans across the globe are and were not always limited by survival, despite the obvious differences across different regimes and times. Therefore, one with superior physical and even cognitive genes can be found with lesser importance to his community than one with an outstanding personality, greater charisma, and higher emotional intelligence. And both of them can be found with lesser importance to their community than one who was born into a family dynasty. On the battle between cognition and physicality, we will delve as well in later chapters.</p>
        <p><u><b>Thinking Exercise:</b></u></p>
        <p>Let's imagine what would have happened to plants and the animal kingdom if they had the freedom and privilege to exercise, shape, and sculpt their bodies just like we do at the gym or when working out, and just like when we go to plastic surgery. On this same line of thought, what would have happened if plants and animals would overconsume food and drinks stuffed with bad nutrition, like we humans do?</p>
        <p>In another View From The Top interview at Stanford, thirteen years later after Ted's interview, Brian Chesky - CEO & Founder of Airbnb, said the following:</p>
        <p>"Somebody asked me what is the biggest thing you've learned or the biggest surprise that you've learned starting Airbnb? And I'll tell you what it is. And this is proven from firsthand experience and from data. You know, Airbnb has been used more than a billion and a half times. It was like the worst idea that ever worked. It wasn't supposed to work. In fact, the first time I told him about the idea, he said: "Brian?"</p>
        <p>I said: "yes".</p>
        <p>He said: "I hope that's not the only idea you're working on."</p>
        <p><b>But a billion and a half times later, what I've realized is that the thing that surprises me is not how different people are, it's actually how similar people are. And I think we live under this illusion that we're so different than everyone else.</b> And I think we tend to focus on the 1% that makes us all different and that's really good. There are really positive parts of preserving our culture and understanding our diversity. But when you start to think the other is so other from you, that gets very, very pernicious."</p>
        <p>One can claim that he is unique and different, other than the rest of the 8.2 billion people who live on Planet Earth. That there's no single person in the world that is identical to him: that thinks the way he thinks, that feels the same emotions, that looks the same, and behaves the same. Maybe it makes sense and he could even prove it genetically. In the same breath, if we would open our scope and observe with larger eyeglasses, is this human really unique and special? Most chances are that he is a very simple man, just like the rest of us. Let's now define Uncommonness and Commonness by exploring the Uncommon Illusion. The Uncommon Illusion is the claim that most human beings lived, currently are living, and will live a common life that will be majorly shaped by the uncommon people. Throughout the posts, we will delve into how uncommonness diverges on different layers, and the analogy between a human leader to an elephant leader is obviously not an apples-to-apples comparison. Note that the posts will keep a motif of open questions and will not supply the answers to challenge the reader to think and to further ask his friends and peers too. Following are two additional thinking questions:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Do you want to be Uncommon? If answered yes, what does it mean to you?</li>
            <li>Do you prefer to be Common? If answered yes, what does it mean to you?</li>
    </ol>
        <p>The goals of these posts are optimistic and not pessimistic! By exploring this idea, I hope to plant more roots, more than we can count, stronger than those that exist today. And in generations to come, these roots will grow into trees that yield higher goods for a healthier, more progressive, and peaceful world.</p>

            <p class="footnote">Footnote: The ranking originates from the book <i>Who's Bigger?: Where Historical Figures Really Rank</i> by computer scientist Steven Skiena and then-Google engineer Charles Ward. In December 2013, Time Magazine featured the list in an article, published just a few months after the book's release. While insightful, the ranking is inherently subjective, as it draws from English-language sources, primarily Wikipedia. The methodology incorporates five key criteria: page views, number of edits, page size, and two additional factors derived from Google PageRank algorithms. These were further adjusted through algorithms to mitigate biases favoring more recent figures. Ultimately, no ranking could be found truly objective. <a href="https://ideas.time.com/2013/12/10/whos-biggest-the-100-most-significant-figures-in-history/" target="_blank">source: Time's website</a>.</p>
