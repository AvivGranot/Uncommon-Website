            <h1>Cameron's Pastry Shop</h1>

        <div class="post-content">
            <p><strong>Below is a case study that may help us further distinguish between commonness and uncommonness:</strong></p>

            <p>Cameron's lifelong dream was to open, operate, and own a local pastry shop near the city where she was born and raised. At just twenty-six, Cameron astonished her family and friends by achieving her dream. She took out two loans and used her savings from temporary jobs she worked at to purchase an old souvenir shop that was closed for months. With her two hands, perspiration, and relentless dedication, Cameron successfully renovated the old shop, redesigned and rebranded it under the new name: "Cameron's Pastry Shop", where she sold hand-made artisan pastries she had dreamt of making since she was six years old.</p>

            <p>David, an old friend from high school who studied math with Cameron, heard about the new store and came for a visit. At the shop, David confessed his affection that never stopped and asked Cameron out. She said yes. At the time, they both were twenty-six; Cameron was running her pastry shop, while David worked as an administrator for a private dentist. David was earning a modest salary, just above the minimum wage. Over the years, Cameron and David's relationship kept blossoming and became a source of inspiration for their friends, community, and family on how to maintain a healthy, kind, and romantic relationship alongside entrepreneurship by one of the partners. As Cameron gave birth to their children, David took on the key role in raising them and managing the household. The pastry shop was growing, and Cameron was just too busy running it, often at the expense of being at home, seeing the children, or even being romantic with David as in the old days.</p>

            <p>Cameron's relentless work ethic made the pastry shop a success: it was thriving, and profits were increasing. Cameron could have retired if she wanted to, but she enjoyed the business so much she retired only at the age of sixty-six. A few months before her retirement, a private investor bought 'Cameron's Pastry Shop' fifty percent above market price. What an accomplishment! Bravo, right? Fifty percent above market price is quite impressive. The couple embarked on a new chapter in life, as David also retired a year later.</p>

            <p>The success of Cameron's Pastry Shop was rich enough to provide their children a carefree and joyful upbringing: family trips abroad twice a year (at least), dinners at fancy restaurants from time to time, jewelry, and designer clothes... Not only that, but Cameron and David also bought each child a house in the neighborhood of the family house to keep the family close.</p>

            <p>Now, let's end the case study and dive into an analysis of the story above. Cameron not only achieved her childhood dream, ran a successful business, and built a family, but she also provided the family with a fortune and secured her children's homes. Let's also say that the shop was profitable from day one and that Cameron was able to repay the loans she took out in less than two years. Without cynicism, it's quite an accomplishment. We should also not underestimate the small ripples the couple created, each in their own way. <strong>This is, my dear readers, the Uncommon Illusion at its finest: Uncommon among the Common</strong>.</p>

            <p>Neither Cameron nor David will be remembered decades or centuries from now. Their efforts, while remarkable, did not impact lives at scale, nor did they create novel breakthroughs to progress the world. Cameron was a great entrepreneur; however, to be considered uncommon, one must excel in their chosen field in extraordinary ways and pursue a purpose far greater than their own lifetime. One must disrupt the status quo and influence tens of millions of lives for generations to come. There's a reason the name William Shakespeare is far more familiar to most of us than the names of his contemporaries, Francis Beaumont and John Fletcher—to the general audience, of course.</p>

            <p>Throughout our lives, we are taught to be entrepreneurs, not uncommon. To aspire to be just like Cameron: to be better than the average. We're educated to strive for success—whether it's retiring at sixty-six with enough pension money and capital to support our children and grandchildren, retiring at forty-four with three homes and ample passive income, or selling a company by the age of thirty, allowing us to spend the rest of our lives pursuing hobbies like surfing in exotic locations, climbing the world's highest peaks, or producing films and art exhibitions.</p>

            <p>As we've just seen, uncommonness isn't confined to purely financial success. It can manifest in other domains: cultural, social, political, scientific, and beyond. Fields where individuals can shape the world in profound and enduring ways.</p>

            <p><strong><u>Let's test ourselves:</u></strong> Do you know, or even care to know, who the most famous chef in Moscow was in 1729, or who was the greatest military leader of the Maya civilization in the seventh century? Are you more interested in knowing who the famous movie stars or senior politicians are today?</p>
