        <h1>"Do not be afraid to give up the good to go for the great" – John D. Rockefeller</h1>

        <p>To truly understand the essence of uncommon individuals, we must first examine the role their environment played in shaping their paths toward greatness. Equally important is recognizing how some of them altered their surroundings to achieve their ambitions. Can we identify times and places where multiple uncommon individuals emerged simultaneously? Take, for example, the 5th and 4th centuries BCE in Ancient Greece. This remarkable era gave the world Socrates, Plato, Xenophon, Aristotle, and Alexander the Great. Such clusters of brilliance invite us to explore deeper questions about the human condition. Let's begin by comparing differences between species in the animal kingdom and humans. These environments, directly or indirectly, leave indelible marks on the lives of both the common and uncommon among us.</p>

        <p><b>Environment:</b><br>
        A starting point between humans and other species in the present era is our ability to consciously change our environment, without being fully dependent upon the new environment for survival. Humans can relocate to more prosperous or less dangerous ones with an awareness of the risks and rewards the new environment presents. While animals can also migrate, separating from the herd often leaves them vulnerable to predators. Even apex predators, who live solitary lives (except during mating seasons), are largely confined to their natural habitat. Most animals are limited by Mother Nature's formidable obstacles: raging rivers, towering mountains, tumultuous oceans, and desolate deserts. On average, animals can overcome only one type of obstacle. For example, the Alpine ibex is uniquely adapted to traverse steep vertical slopes and rugged terrains at elevations between 1,800 to 3,300 meters (5,900 to 10,800 feet). However, it cannot swim, making it incapable of crossing wide rivers or oceans. Marine animals, on the other hand, can swim vast distances, even from pole to pole, but they cannot walk on land or scale mountain peaks. Insects and bacteria may seem immune to these limitations, but their ability to traverse environments is unintentional. They "hitchhike" on human backs, ships, or airplanes, without a conscious effort. While the great achievements of Ferdinand Magellan's expedition to successfully circumnavigate the globe between 1519 and 1522, the Montgolfier brothers, who pioneered human aviation with the first manned hot air balloon flight on June 4, 1783, and flew for ten minutes to a height of 914.4 meters, or of the Wright brothers, when they achieved the first powered flight on December 17, 1903, humans had already been crossing oceans by ship and passing mountains by foot or riding animals for centuries. Yet despite those achievements, and long before humans developed the means to circumnavigate the globe or take to the skies, birds had already mastered flight. Birds can consciously change their environment, overcome nature's obstacles, and remain apex predators in some cases. Birds can only thrive in new environments if the climate is favorable, food is abundant, and predators are manageable. Therefore, they're dependent on their new environment.</p>

        <p>Through our cognitive superiority, humans have developed tools that allow us to overcome and reduce our dependence on new environments. The renaissance of cognitive superiority began with humanity's ability to document information. Even if one could argue that certain animal species possess a richer verbal language than humans, he would fail to prove that any animal species has a written language richer than ours. The true catalyst for cognitive superiority was not merely the ability to document information but to preserve it for future generations. We possess the unique ability to document knowledge, preserving the original message indefinitely and allowing each generation to build upon the last. Without written language, there is no clear documentation, and without preserving documentation, there is no past from which to learn. The mature of us played extensively the child’s game of ‘Broken Telephone’, where a message is whispered from one player to the next and inevitably becomes distorted or lost by the end. The game amplifies the importance of documentation and its preservation. I’ll give you an example: we can only guess about the knowledge of how we built the pyramids of Giza, Egypt. If we could have preserved the lost knowledge, the course of human history and its present intelligence would have been forever different. Humans can consciously learn, innovate, and adapt, transcending the constraints of natural evolution. Animals, on the other hand, adapt to their environment primarily through evolution - a slow and gradual process that spans thousands, even tens of thousands of years. Before humans developed the ability to document and preserve information, their learning process mirrored that of animals, relying on observation, imitation, and trial and error. As far as I know, there is no written guide titled “10 Rules for Becoming the Strongest Siberian Tiger”. Animals cannot access stored knowledge about the dangers and opportunities in a new environment; they can only learn from direct observation and immediate experience. When they enter unfamiliar territory, they have no resources to draw upon for understanding threats or opportunities. Instead, they must rely on instinct and trial and error adaptation within their known surroundings. The evolution process of learning and knowledge acquisition through trial and error is an inherently slower process than learning through the preservation and sharing of information. To this day, there is no evidence to suggest that animals possess the ability to document and preserve knowledge in the way early humans did. If they could, perhaps the world would indeed be home to nine billion elephants! Or more realistically, to other species achieving human-like levels of prosperity.</p>

        <p>We must remember and not forget that it is important to recognize that even among humans, the freedom to consciously change environments and adapt is not universal. In democratic and developed nations, individuals often have the liberty to relocate safely. In stark contrast, a Syrian teenager fleeing civil war in search of a better future faces horrific consequences if caught whether by local authorities or hostile groups. Meanwhile, a teenager from London or Paris can book a plane ticket to Sydney, and start a new life, a new beginning without survival threats. Now that we understand how, besides humans, no species possesses the ability to consciously adapt and thrive across environments without being entirely subordinate to them, we can better appreciate the significance of this human advantage in shaping Uncommon People, and whether there is a need to change our environment.</p>

        <p>A few years ago, I had a conversation with one of the leading architects in my country, and the best in my perspective. During our conversation, he asked me a thought-provoking question: "Aviv, why do you think I am chosen to design the most complex projects in the country today, even though I only immigrated here five years ago with my family? Why do you think architects with a broader portfolio of local projects aren’t being selected for these innovative and complicated projects?" I paused, unable to provide an answer. He continued: "It’s because they have never designed a tower above fourteen stories. How can they be expected to design a one-hundred-story skyscraper?” He further explained: “When I worked at some of the best architecture firms in the world and was mentored by the top architects of the world, I gained unparalleled expertise and experience. Competing among the best architects globally shaped me into a highly skilled professional. But here, in our country, no other architect has the knowledge or experience that I’ve accumulated, which is why I’m consistently chosen for the most challenging and groundbreaking projects." As we continued our conversation, he said something that has stayed with me ever since: "When you’re at the drafting table, you can’t fake it."
        </p>

        <p><b>Let’s analyze his words:</b> Will humanity be more impacted by an architect who has designed thousands of identical characteristics residential units, with minimal variations and no substantial differences, or by an architect whose work shattered existing norms, significantly advanced the field of architecture, and profoundly transformed how people perceive and interact with their spaces? </p>

        <p><b>Let's test ourselves:</b><br>
        What kind of architect do we aspire to become? Which one are we educated to be? Which one are we encouraged to pursue? Does scale alone define uncommonness, or is it the ability to innovate and challenge the status quo that truly matters?</p>

        <p>Again and again, the motif here is not to diminish the achievements of local architects but to shed light on the role of environment and the essence of the Uncommon Illusion.</p>
