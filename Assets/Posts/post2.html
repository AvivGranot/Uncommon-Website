        <div class="post-content">
            <p>Let us begin by paying tribute to all the uncommon individuals who never received the recognition they deserved for their actions. These are the people whose remarkable contributions were overshadowed or went unnoticed. These individuals remained in the shadows despite the fact they shaped the world we're familiar with today. We must honor their sacrifices: who took bold actions, bore great burdens, and risked their lives to spark change and send ripples to the world.</p>

            <p>When I refer to the phrase "the world", I mean that our world encompasses not only the human species but also all of nature, the animal kingdom, and even realms beyond the boundaries of our planet. The circumstances that shaped these individuals in the past provided a unique framework for them to emerge. However, those conditions cannot fully mirror the circumstances of the present, nor of the future. Therefore, our mission is to identify the pivotal turning point, the uncommon paths these individuals chose to walk. Perhaps even more enlightening will be examining the common paths they chose to avoid.</p>

            <p>Our journey should not focus solely on the shared character traits of figures such as Abraham Lincoln and Peter the Great. If annexing such traits was an easy task, self-help books, lectures, courses, and other forms of personal development content would have vanished from the world. It's not so easy to change a character. If it was the case, then common people would have simply needed to read Lincoln's or Peter the Great biographies, and that's it. Yet, as the world is changing so rapidly, and the circumstances of Julius Caesar to his advantage, rising to the dictator of the Roman Empire, are not identical, nor similar to an aspiring uncommon person today.</p>

            <p>Moreover, as we delve deeper into our journey, it becomes evident that uncommon people, even when they longed for satisfaction, satisfaction was rarely found. Uncommon people push to seek to achieve virtues only a narrow few achieved before. To shatter the 'status-quo', and to redefine history. Let us then annihilate the word "enough" from our lexicon, as uncommon individuals can never fully reconcile with its definition.</p>

            <h2>Entrepreneurship VS. Uncommonness</h2>

            <p>If there was a competition for the most sexy, and most used word in the business world today, "Entrepreneur" would likely win. In the past, words like "doctor", "lawyer", or "philosopher" might have won. Courses on entrepreneurship have become as ubiquitous as toothpicks, and the number of individuals identifying as entrepreneurs has skyrocketed. Alongside this meteoric surge, there's been an explosion of lectures, interviews, and books about it. Success in entrepreneurship is anything but a precise science. If there was a winning formula, proven, and easy to implement, it would already have been universally adopted, and the so-called "miracle" of entrepreneurship wouldn't be celebrated as it is today. While there are undoubtedly valuable lessons by learning from past ventures, these guidelines are not akin to Einstein's equation, E = mc², or as straightforward as 2 + 2 = 4.</p>

            <p>Unlike the entrepreneur, the uncommon individual operates on a higher ground. An entrepreneur may achieve glory, fame, and immense wealth during his or her lifetime. But what happens after their death, or more importantly, what's their legacy in centuries to come? A successful entrepreneur, and successful as he or she will be, surprisingly though, may prevail as common. Common among the ones who fill the different layers between commonness and uncommonness. His or her actions' are far better than those of average people, but will never be at the level of the uncommon people. Consider the influence of an ice cream entrepreneur, for example. His or her focus is solely on manufacture, distribution, and marketing ice creams. Within this narrow field, his or her impact on humanity, while significant in its own right, pales in comparison to that of truly uncommon individuals. Even with substantial wealth and assets, can their legacy rival the profound influence of Albert Einstein, Napoleon Bonaparte, or Aristotle?</p>

            <p>Now we begin to understand that excelling in all of the different verticals of an ice cream maker, might lead someone to become a successful entrepreneur. However, it most always won't elevate to the ranks of an uncommon individual. Our successful ice cream entrepreneur has undoubtedly created meaningful contributions to the greater world: colleagues, competitors, employees, and even strangers may learn from his achievements. Nor should we underestimate the power of the small ripples he or she had generated. Yet, in contrast, those who produce a mighty current of ripples and transformative values, impacting countless lives and shaping the world for generations, earn their place among the uncommon people.</p>

            <p>For instance, Thomas Edison was granted 1,093 patents in the United States alone and a total of 2,332 worldwide. Even if he had registered only a handful of patents, his financial and social status would likely have skyrocketed. However, Edison is universally regarded as an uncommon individual not because of his inventions, but because he consistently created value after value, and generated an immense amount of ripples that advanced the world in profound and lasting ways.</p>

            <blockquote>
                "Few will have the greatness to bend history itself, but each of us can work to change a small portion of events. It is from numberless diverse acts of courage and belief that human history is shaped. Each time a man stands up for an ideal, or acts to improve the lot of others, or strikes out against injustice, he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope, and crossing each other from a million different centers of energy and daring those ripples build a current which can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance."
            </blockquote>
