        <h1>“Good steel can withstand any temperature” - Empress Dowager T'zu-his; Uncommon people withstand the test of time</h1>
        
        <p>Let us begin by paying tribute to all the uncommon individuals who never received the recognition they deserved for their actions. These are the people whose remarkable contributions were overshadowed or went unnoticed, sometimes due to humanity’s inability to see their significance. Whether it was their circumstances, or deliberate efforts to obscure their impact for personal gains, these individuals often remained in the shadows despite shaping the world around them. We must honor their sacrifices: those who took bold steps, bore great burdens, and even risked their lives to ignite change and send ripples to the world. Their ripples, though often uncredited, have influenced progress far beyond their time. It is crucial to shed light on their stories, not only to do justice to their efforts but also to inspire us to recognize and support the uncommon among us today. Their legacy is a testament to the power of vision and action, even when it goes unnoticed.</p>
        <p>In this book, "the world" encompasses not only the human species but also all of nature, the animal kingdom, and even realms beyond the boundaries of our planet. The circumstances that shaped these individuals in the past provided a unique framework for their emergence. However, those conditions cannot fully mirror the circumstances of the present or the future for any of us. Our mission, then, is to identify the pivotal turning points—the uncommon paths these individuals chose to walk. Perhaps even more enlightening will be examining the common paths they deliberately avoided, offering lessons in the decisions that set them apart from the majority.</p>
        <p>Our journey should not focus solely on the shared character traits of figures like Abraham Lincoln and Peter the Great. If adopting such traits were straightforward, self-help books, lectures, courses, and other forms of personal development content would no longer exist. Common people would simply need to study Lincoln or Peter the Great to transform their lives, rendering the vast industry of self-empowerment obsolete. It would be far more productive to examine the events Julius Caesar leveraged to his advantage, ultimately rising to become the dictator of the Roman Empire. Furthermore, understanding how such strategies can be applied in one’s own life adds practical value to this exploration.</p>
        <p>Although Julius Caesar may not be the best example, we can turn to a figure with better values - George Washington, perhaps. Moreover, as we delve deeper into our journey, it becomes evident that uncommon people, even when they longed for satisfaction, rarely found it. Their insatiable drive pushed them to seek greater accomplishments, to achieve virtues only a narrow few achieved before. Let us, then, annihilate the word "enough," as these individuals could never fully reconcile with its meaning.</p>
        <p><b>Entrepreneurship Vs. Uncommonness:</b></p>
        <p>If there were a contest for the sexiest and frequently used word in the business world today, "entrepreneur" would likely take the crown. In the past, words like "doctor," "lawyer," "general," or "philosopher" might have claimed the spotlight. Courses on entrepreneurship have become as ubiquitous as toothpicks, and the number of individuals identifying as entrepreneurs has skyrocketed. Alongside this meteoric surge, there’s been an explosion of lectures, interviews, and books on the topic. Success in entrepreneurship is anything but a precise science. If a winning formula existed, proven, and easy to implement, it would already have been universally adopted, and the so-called "miracle" of entrepreneurship wouldn’t be celebrated as it is today. While there are undoubtedly valuable lessons to learn from past ventures, these guidelines are not akin to Einstein’s equation, E = mc², or as straightforward as 2 + 2 = 4. Unlike the entrepreneur, the uncommon individual operates in a higher atmosphere. An entrepreneur may achieve glory, fame, and immense wealth during their lifetime. But what happens after their death, or more importantly, centuries later? A successful entrepreneur might, surprisingly though, prevail as common, common even among the uncommon. Consider the influence of an ice cream entrepreneur, for example. If their focus is solely on manufacturing, distribution, and marketing within this narrow field, their impact on humanity, while significant in its own right, pales in comparison to that of truly uncommon individuals. Even with substantial wealth and assets, can their legacy rival the profound influence of Albert Einstein, Napoleon Bonaparte, or John D. Rockefeller?</p>
        <p>Now we understand that creating only a limited scope of values doesn’t always lead to being uncommon. Excelling in the top management, marketing, and distribution of an ice cream supply chain might establish someone as a successful entrepreneur. However, it doesn’t necessarily elevate them to the status of an uncommon individual in the test of time. Our successful ice cream entrepreneur has undoubtedly created meaningful contributions: colleagues, competitors, employees, and even strangers may learn from his achievements. Nor should we underestimate the power of the small ripples he has generated. Whether it’s the joy and delight sparked by tasting his ice cream, relationships formed through shared moments, or even the self-discovery inspired by a failed date at his shop. Yet, creating a few ripples and localized value does not inherently make someone uncommon. In contrast, those who produce a mighty current of ripples and transformative values, impacting countless lives and shaping the world for generations, earn their place among the uncommon people.</p>
        <p>For instance, Thomas Edison was granted 1,093 patents in the United States alone and a total of 2,332 worldwide . Even if he had registered only a handful of patents, his financial and social status would likely have skyrocketed. However, Edison is universally regarded as an uncommon individual not just because of his inventions but because he consistently created value and generated ripples that advanced the world in profound and lasting ways.</p>
        <p>To quote Robert F. Kennedy's beautiful, inspiring words: <b>“Few will have the greatness to bend history itself, but each of us can work to change a small portion of events. It is from numberless diverse acts of courage and belief that human history is shaped. Each time a man stands up for an ideal, or acts to improve the lot of others, or strikes out against injustice, he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope, and crossing each other from a million different centers of energy and daring those ripples build a current which can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance”.</b></p>
