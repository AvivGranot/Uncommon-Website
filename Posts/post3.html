        <h1>Below is an example that may help strike root in the confusion between the Common and the Uncommon:</h1>
        <p>Cameron’s lifelong dream was to open, operate, and own a local pastry shop near the city where she was born and raised. At just twenty-six, a remarkably young age, Cameron astonished her family and friends by achieving her dream. She pooled her savings from allowances and temporary jobs to purchase an old souvenir shop that had been closed for months. With hard work and dedication, she renovated the space and proudly named it <b>Cameron Pastry Shop</b>, as declared by the green sign above its golden doors.</p>     
        <p>Not long after the opening of Cameron Pastry Shop, David won Cameron’s heart. He was also twenty-six, and the two had known each other since sharing math classes in high school. David worked as an office manager for a private dentist, earning a modest salary just above minimum wage. Over the years, their relationship blossomed, becoming a source of inspiration for friends and family. Eventually, they married, and when their children were born, David took on a more central role in raising them and managing the household. Meanwhile, Cameron devoted herself tirelessly to running Cameron Pastry Shop, dedicating long hours and most of her time to the business, often at the expense of being home. </p>
        <p>Thanks to Cameron’s relentless effort, the shop thrived, generating enough profit to sustain the family and enable Cameron to continue running it until her voluntary retirement at the age of sixty-six. Shortly before her long-awaited retirement, Cameron finalized a deal with a private investor to sell her business at a twenty percent premium over market value - quite the accomplishment! Bravo, right? Around the same time, David retired as well, marking the beginning of a new chapter in their lives together. </p> 
        <p>The success of Cameron Pastry Shop provided their children with a joyful and carefree upbringing. Family trips abroad at least twice a year, dinners at upscale restaurants on weekends, jewelry and designer clothes, summer camps, elite clubs, and more. But Cameron and David didn’t stop there. When their children turned twenty-one, the couple purchased each of them an apartment in a building just a block away from the family home, to keep the family close as common these days. </p>
        <p><b>Now, let’s delve into the details and analyze the story above:</b></p>
        <p>Cameron not only achieved her lifelong dream, but with David’s support, the couple provided their children with a rich, joyful, and carefree upbringing. On top of that, they managed to purchase apartments for their children, securing their future. Without a hint of cynicism, it’s clear that their accomplishments stand well above average. Wouldn’t you agree? Once again, we must neither underestimate nor diminish the small ripples created by Cameron Pastry Shop. Nor should we overlook the ripples David generated through his dedication to raising their children and his work. <b>This is the Uncommon Illusion at its finest: Uncommon among the Common.</b></p>
        <p>Neither Cameron nor David will be remembered decades or centuries from now. Their efforts, while remarkable, did not impact millions of lives, nor did they create monumental ripples to advance the world. Without a doubt, Cameron was an exceptional entrepreneur. However, to be considered truly uncommon, one must excel in their chosen field in extraordinary ways, pursuing a purpose far greater than their own lifetime. They must disrupt the status quo and influence tens of millions of lives for generations to come. There’s a reason the name William Shakespeare is far more familiar to most of us than the names of his contemporaries, Francis Beaumont and John Fletcher  - playwrights who lived and worked during the same era.</p>
        <p>Throughout our lives, we are taught to aspire to be like Cameron: to chase after the uncommon among the common. We’re educated to strive for success. Whether it’s retiring at sixty-six with enough pension money and capital to support our children and grandchildren, retiring at forty-four with three homes and ample passive income, or achieving a major financial exit by thirty, allowing us to spend the rest of our lives pursuing hobbies like surfing in exotic locations, climbing the world’s highest peaks, or producing films and art exhibitions. </p>
        <p>As we’ve discussed, uncommonness isn’t confined to financial success. It can manifest in other domains: culture, social leadership, politics, science, and beyond. Fields where individuals can shape the world in profound and enduring ways.</p>
        <p><b><u>Let’s test ourselves:</u></b></p>
        <p>Do you know, or even care to know, who the most famous chef in Moscow was in 1729? Or the greatest military leader of the Maya civilization in the seventh century? Are you more interested in knowing who is considered a famous movie star or a senior politician today?</p>
