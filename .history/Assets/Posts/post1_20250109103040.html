        <h1>“God must have loved the common man, that he created so many of them” – Abraham Lincoln</h1>
        <p>From a statistical point of view, every living creature is born with a different gene composition, differentiating him from a second living creature. This fact is a fundamentally important rule of thumb, upon its derivatives the following questions must be produced: What exactly differentiates one living creature from a second? Can two living creatures, and not from a genetic perspective solely, be completely identical or at least similar to a particularly high degree? Furthermore, why do we feel so unique, as some of us must have felt so in our lifetime?</p>
        <p>The purpose of this blog is to answer these questions and in addition, to give a new perspective to the following ones: does history enumerate and agree upon a group of people, which through their deeds, are reminisced as “Uncommon People”? If we will be able to settle a consensus on the latter, then who are the “Common People”? What does it mean to be “Common” and what does it mean to be “Uncommon”? <b>Let’s find out!</b></p>

        <p>Below is Time Magazine’s ranking of the 100 most influential figures in history, highlighting individuals whose impact has shaped the course of human civilization:</p>
        <img src="../Assets/Images/test who's biggest.jpg" alt="Ranking Chart" class="image">
        <p class="footnote">Footnote: The ranking originates from the book <i>Who’s Bigger?: Where Historical Figures Really Rank</i> by computer scientist Steven Skiena and then-Google engineer Charles Ward. In December 2013, Time Magazine featured the list in an article, published just a few months after the book’s release. While insightful, the ranking is inherently subjective, as it draws from English-language sources, primarily Wikipedia. The methodology incorporates five key criteria: page views, number of edits, page size, and two additional factors derived from Google PageRank algorithms. These were further adjusted through algorithms to mitigate biases favoring more recent figures. Ultimately, no ranking could be found truly objective. <a href="https://ideas.time.com/2013/12/10/whos-biggest-the-100-most-significant-figures-in-history/" target="_blank">source: Time's website</a>.</p>
        <p>We would find it relatively easy to identify Uncommon People from the above list. We may be familiar with some of these figures in-depth, while others might be known to us only by name, in a distanced memory. <b>Today, even if there are approximately one thousand uncommon individuals among the 8.025 billion people on Earth, they represent an extraordinarily tiny fraction - just 0.000000124610592%.</b> Furthermore, if we tried to find one thousand random individuals who each recognized a different uncommon figure, the task would prove nearly impossible. When considering the total number of people who have lived throughout history, this percentage becomes even more minuscule.</p>
        <p>‘View From The Top" is a longstanding tradition at Stanford University, where MBA students conduct personal interviews with some of the most prominent figures of their time. In April 2010, the renowned speaker was the prominent Ted Turner. Best known as the founder of CNN: the first 24-hour cable news network. Ted is also recognized for his leadership as chairman of the United Nations Foundation, to which he generously donated one billion dollars. Additionally, Ted is the second largest private landowner in North America, with an impressive holding of approximately eight million dunams. “Turner lands are innovatively managed to unite economic viability with ecological sustainability”.</p>
        <p>Ted, a father of five and three-time divorcee, highlighted two primary contributors to global warming: the sharp rise in human population: a more than threefold increase during his lifetime. And the significant growth in life expectancy. The chart below illustrates these changes, showcasing the exponential rise in world population from 2.24 billion in 1938 to nearly 7 billion by 2010, alongside the increase in global life expectancy from 64 years to 79 years over the same period.</p>
        <img src="../Assets/Images/Ted Turner Graphs.jpg" alt="Ted Turner Graph" class="image">
        <p>In his characteristic idiosyncratic style, balancing humor with blunt seriousness, Ted Turner posed an unexpected question to the audience: “Do you know what would happen if nine billion elephants lived on planet Earth?” He paused, then delivered the punchline with perfect timing: <b>“Don’t spend your time with dumb people, only with smart ones.”</b></p>
        <p><b><u>Let’s ask ourselves in a completely serious manner:</b></u> if nine billion elephants were to live on planet Earth, what the heck they actually do? It is safe to assume these elephants would spend most of their time engaging in the fundamentals of survival: sleeping, eating, and roaming through savannas and jungles in search of the best food and water sources. They would instinctively seek areas rich in resources while steering clear of predators and potential dangers. And, of course, they would breed to ensure the continuity of their species. But elephants, like many animals, are not solitary creatures; they live in herds. Within these herds, leadership plays a crucial role in survival. In nature, the leaders are not chosen randomly. They are typically the strongest, most muscular individuals, those capable of defending the herd against threats, emerging victorious in life-or-death battles, and ensuring the safety and survival of future generations. On paper, herds’ leaders are born with superior physiological traits, compared to their contemporaries. For those elephants born with less physical competence, however, life within the herd is far more precarious.</p>
        <p>The weak are often the first targets for predators, and they face higher risks in confrontations for dominance or territory. In some cases, these individuals are left behind by the herd, isolated when their inability to keep up slows the group’s progress. Without the protection of the herd, their survival becomes nearly impossible. Whether due to starvation, predation, or random misfortune, their lives are often tragically short. It is no surprise that in many herds, females prefer to mate with leaders, particularly the alpha males. This priority ensures that their offspring inherit superior genetic traits, enhancing their chances of <a href="#footnote1" id="survival-footnote">survival<sup>1</sup></a>. Yet, in some species like humans, mating may occur out of rapport, mutual attraction, or even forms of affection, what we might interpret as love. Charles Darwin referred to this dynamic as <a href="#footnote2" id="sexual-selection-footnote">sexual selection<sup>2</sup></a>. Still, the complexity of life cannot be confined to genetics alone. Surely, we can agree on that, can’t we?</p>
        <p>We already know that several additional layers significantly influence the selection of a herd’s leader, including environmental factors and character traits. This principle applies equally to the human race. From an evolutionary perspective, humans have historically adapted to live in small tribes and communities, which gradually evolved into larger and more complex social structures. with superior physical or cognitive traits might hold less importance within their community compared to another with an exceptional personality. Likewise, both could be overshadowed by a third individual born into a privileged family. These intricate dynamics between cognition, physicality, and lineage will be explored further throughout this blog.</p>
        <p><u><b>Thinking Questions:</b></u> What if the animal kingdom and nature had the freedom to design and train their bodies, much like bodybuilders or individuals undergoing plastic surgeries, how would such a world appear, and how would it function? What changes might these altered physical traits bring to the interactions between species, and between humans and animals?</p>
        <p>Brian Chesky, co-founder and CEO of Airbnb, shared the following during a View From The Top interview, approximately thirteen years after Ted Turner’s appearance: “Somebody asked me what is the biggest thing you’ve learned or the biggest surprise that you’ve learned starting Airbnb? And I tell you what it is. And this is proven from firsthand experience and from data.
            You know, Airbnb has been used more than a billion and a half times. It was like the worst idea that ever worked. It wasn’t supposed to work. In fact, the first time I told him about the idea, he said:
            Brian? I said: yes? He said: I hope that’s not the only idea you’re working on. <b>But a billion and a half times later, what I’ve realized is that the thing that surprise me is not how different people are, it’s actually how similar people are. And I think we live under this illusion that we’re so different than everyone else.</b></p>
        <p><b>The Uncommon Illusion:</b>The Uncommon Illusion is the underlying principle that the vast majority of people, past, present, and future, live common lives. Lives who are profoundly shaped by the actions and achievements of uncommon individuals. This blog will embrace the motif of open-ended questions, deliberately avoiding definitive answers to encourage us to think critically, form our own perspectives, and engage with our surroundings.</p>
        <p><u><b>Following are two additional questions:</b></u> Does one truly long to become an uncommon person? And where does the inspiration or lack of desire to pursue uncommonness originate?</p>
